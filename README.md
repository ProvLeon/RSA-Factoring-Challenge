## RSA Factoring Challenge ##
This is a Project from **ALX SE on Full Stack Software Development**
This Project challenges the Developer, as to how to write a code to factorize certain numbers as fast as possible before the target machine detects our code as a bug and fix it on the server.
This enables the student to decode encrypted documents.

Here you will find code related to Factoring & RSA Challenge

## LIST OF TASKS
|Tasks | Details|
|`0. Factorize all the things!`| Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller num|Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.
|`1. RSA Factoring Challenge` | RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number n, there exist prime numbers p and q such that n = p Ã— q. The problem is to find these two primes, given only n.|
